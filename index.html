            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome! This website serves as my Journal of Progress for my Honors Capstone Project, The Coding Box, at James Madison University.</p>
            <h3>What is The Coding Box?</h3>
            <p>The Coding Box is a web-based learning tool for Computer Science students, Designed to help students learn to think algorithmically. On this website, students can learn to solve a variety of problems, simply by understanding the input and output. However, the function of the problem is hidden by a "Mystery Box", and students must figure it out based on the inputs and outputs, then proceed to implement their idea of what the function is doing.</p>
            <p>Instructors can use The Coding Box with their own supplied problems, as well as use a library of user-submitted ones, to assess students' computational thinking skills.</p>
