            <h3>Preface</h3>
            <p>Due to the severe lack of progress the last few entries, This week's entry will be significantly longer, in order to make enough progress for the project approval, however unlikely it may be at this stage.</p>
            <p>An aside: In a typical college course, the general guideline is to work twice as much outside of class as in class, in other words, the number of credit hours times three. Therefore, In CS 499A, I should have expected to accomplish at least three hours of progress per week. However, in the time I have been keeping this journal, I have only done about one-third to one-half of that, including my weekly meetings with Dr. Johnson, which is extremely concerning. Therefore, as I write this, on April 26, 2022, I wuill be attempting to make up for that by doing what every college student dreads, but ultimately does at some point: pulling an all-nighter.</p>
            <p>In contrast to my previous journal entries, this entry will be periodically updated over the course of the night, approximately every three hours. Each update will be prefaced with the time it was added.</p>
            <h3>Update 1 - TBD</h3>
            <p>See you soon (maybe next Semester),</p>
