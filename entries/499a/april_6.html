            <h2>April 6, 2022</h2>
            <p>This week, I did not get much of substance done, due to a general lack of motivation and free time. However, before next week I would like to get a rough draft of the proposal paper finished, and I plan to reach out to potential readers for the project, such as Dr. Stewart, Dr. Weikle, or Dr. Lam. In addition, I am going to continue exploring potential frameworks to use for the site, and possibly learn a bit on my own about certain advanced web topics necessary for the project, such as user authentication, and possibly Docker.</p>
            <p>See you next week (Hopefully with something showable),</p>
