            <h2>April 13, 2022</h2>
            <p>This week, I spent most of my time working on a decent draft of the Proposal paper. It can be accessed via a private Google Docs Link that I have shared with Dr. Johnson. However, I will not be posting the link here for security reasons. I also am planning on talking to Dr. Stewart and Dr. Weikle later this week about being readers for my project, likely during their office hours, and I plan to share the draft with them as well. By next week, I plan to finish the proposal and submit it to the Honors College, and begin planning a possible structure for CS 499B and CS 499C (which is also part of the proposal outline in Part III: Methodology and Timeline). Also, I would like to begin coming up with a list of goals for what I want to accomplish over the summer with regards to the project.</p>
            <p>See you next week,</p>
